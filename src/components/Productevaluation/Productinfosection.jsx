        </h4>
        <p className="text-gray-700 font-Nunito leading-relaxed mb-2">
          Every year, IRRI invites new-variety nomination (recently released) from national breeding centers in prescribed template. Once the varietal nominations from different breeders are received, those are categorized under preferred market segments.
        </p>
        <div className="bg-green-50 font-parkinsans border-l-4 border-green-600 text-green-800 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
          Based on the seeds availability and relevance of the varieties in target market segments and geography, nominations are finalized and put to test under adaptive trials (OFT).
        </div>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-2">
          Through various years of evolution and diverse designs and lay-outs exercised to run these trials, these are popularly known as H2H(Head to Head), TRICOTs (Tradic trials), OFTs (On-farm trials) or adaptive trials.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-2">
          These multi-location trials are primarily designed using TRICOT principles, to compare nearly 3-4 new rice varieties with local checks and established benchmarks under the associated market segment. Managed directly by farmers under real-world conditions, adaptive trials provide realistic estimates of genetic gain under farmer managed conditions and capture variability and average productivity in a more significant manner.
