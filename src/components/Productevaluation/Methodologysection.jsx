        Each year, breeders and NARES partners nominate new rice varieties for testing across India.
        These are grouped into five market segments

          Trial sets are tested at ≥15 sites per state, ensuring site-specific needs are covered.
          Best performers from previous seasons are retained in the pool. Allocations are randomized, and KVKs and other extension partners coordinate implementation.
          Farmers receive seed kits and support before sowing, and partners undergo training to ensure standardized trial management.

        <p className="font-Nunito text-gray-700">
          Quantitative traits were analyzed using a Mixed Linear Model (BLUP). Trial reliability was evaluated through broad-sense heritability (H2) and coefficient of determination (R2). Predicted values for each variable were tested for significance at the 95% confidence level.

        <p className="font-Nunito text-gray-700">
          Transplanting was ensured at 18–20 days after sowing (DAS) for early maturity market segments,
          25–30 DAS for medium maturity, and 30–35 DAS for late maturity. Each variety was transplanted on 200 sqm, with uniform nutrient management across replications and a seed rate of 40 kg/ha.

        <p className="font-Nunito">
          In DSR trials, dry DSR was adopted with pre-treated seed drilled using precision planters on approximately 500 sqm plots.
          Sowing used 25 kg/ha for hybrids, 40 kg/ha for HYVs at 2–3 cm depth. Light irrigation followed sowing; 1–2 additional irrigations were given in highly drought soils.
          Moisture was maintained during key stages (tillering, panicle initiation, grain filling).
          Standard herbicides and site-specific weed management were applied.

              Phenotypic data on traits - tillering, plant height, panicle length, grains per panicle, spikelet fertility, test weight, and pests and diseases - are collected.
              For DSR segments, anaerobic germination and emergence (10 DAS), vegetative vigour (15 DAS), and canopy cover (30 DAS), along with nematode infestation are recorded.
